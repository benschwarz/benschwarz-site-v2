%section#bio
  %p Ben Schwarz is a well known Melbourne Rubyist who funds his love of good food (at home) and sake (in bars) by designing sophisticated web applications using standards based technology. More than anything else, he is driven by a maniacal desire to produce not only elegant code, but also beautiful software in the hands of its&nbsp;users.

    %h1 Professional process
    %p Every facet of my professional practice encompasses “humane design”, whether it be architecture, storyboarding or code. Currently, I manage projects using something like agile and lean mixed together. Most development work is conducted using BDD and/or TDD, depending on the flavour of&nbsp;project.
