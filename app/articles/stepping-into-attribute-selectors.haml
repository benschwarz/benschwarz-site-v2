    For years we've been using IDs in our markup: `#wrapper`, `#page`, `#header`, `#footer`, `#sidebar` and other friends. One of the efforts of HTML5 has been recognising these common patterns, and for a for a few years now we've had tags like `<header>`, `<footer>` and `<aside>`.

    These tags go quite aways to replacing the commonly used IDs in our markup, although due to the nature of document hierarchy, there are commonly many headers and footers within a HTML page.

    So, the practice that I've been following alongside using the newer tags is the usage of some simple [ARIA roles](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles) to semantically describe my content. 

    Specifically, "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#banner">banner</a>" ("A region that contains mostly site-oriented content, rather than page-specific content"), "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#main">main"</a> ("The main content of a document"), and finally "<a href="contentinfo">contentinfo</a>" (A large perceivable region that contains information about the parent document).

    Perhaps the header on line 12 can be used for styling, perhaps its not required at all, but now using some simple CSS selectors we have control over the `<header>` tags used in our markup.

    For those of you who aren't targeting IE6, or better yet, totally not supporting it, the good news is that IE (7+) supports attribute selectorsâ€¦ and, of course if you wanted to continue to support IE6, you could drop in <a href="http://selectivizr.com/">selectivizr</a> and move on with your life.

  %p It appears that Jeremy Keith <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/4267/">wrote about this</a> at the start of the year, but, being that I wrote this before realising Jeremy's article existed, I'll publish it anyway. (+1 Jeremy)
